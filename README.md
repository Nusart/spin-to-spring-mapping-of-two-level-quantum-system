# spin-to-spring-mapping-of-two-level-quantum-system
In this project, we have tried to study the behaviour of the Spin Magnetization
Vector of a nucleus subjected to a constant magnetic field on application of
Radio Frequency Pulse. For solving the coupled first order differential
equations of the trajectory of this vector, we have used the fourth order
Runge-Kutta method. We have taken the help of a widely used python Toolbox
in Quantum Mechanics called QuTiP to make the simulation of the Spin
Magnetization Vector on the Bloch sphere.
